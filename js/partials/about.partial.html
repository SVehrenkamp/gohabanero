        <p>This bold flavor enhancer is a sauce that has humble roots.  Established in 2013 when founder, Dean Steele, was experimenting in his kitchen with habanero peppers he had just picked from his family garden.  The result was a delightfully unique sauce that brings life to nearly any dish.  It was a true hit at the Steele family barbecues that summer and after many requests from friends, GO HABANERO went into full scale production.
